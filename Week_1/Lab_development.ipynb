    "# Development Environment Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this simple lab we will set up the scaffolding for the development of your project with respect to file structure, documentation, and development environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "To instill the practice and discipline of standardizing your development process. Please, do not become too comfortable with a *specific* way of doing things. For example, it's nice if you like to organize your projects and documentation or sytle your code a certain way, but when you join a new team, you may be expected to switch over to their way of doing things. You must do this, and be a team player, even if you believe your way is the *right* way. It isn't. The *right* way is however the team decides, and it may change from team to team, company to company. If you are very opinionated, you may be lucky enough to join a new team that has not yet established their best practices, and then you can have your say and influence the team.\n",

    "### Virtual Environments\n",

    "Next, let's create a virtual environment for the work you will be doing in this class. You can use virtual environments in python, or you can use conda. It is up to you. "

    "3. Create a requirements.txt file. Include mlfow, scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy. I'm not going to be prescriptive, so please include whatever version number you want for each of these libraries.  \n",
    "4. Install libraries from your requirements.txt file using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip freeze` or `pip list` will allow you to see the libraries you've installed. Upon creating your virtual environment, this should return nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can, but are not required to, create a **setup.py** file which would hold some metadata about our project, and also details about the libraries we installed (e.g. which libraries are *required* in production versus which are used only for development purposes). Later on in the course we will create a **pyproject.toml** file which will hold some other configurations for us, but I find having a separate setup.py file to be just another list of things that I will forget to keep track of, so I won't be using it."

For the work we will be doing for the project, labs, and demos, we will be doing a lot of typical ML training processes, like adding data, writing model-training scripts, using Jupyter notebooks, and writing other pieces of code.\n",

    "1. Create other folders for your project. You may want a folder for all of your project notebooks, a folder for data, a folder for models. Start with the bare minimum, and add new folders when you need them, rather than creating a bunch of folders that you may not ever need.\n",
